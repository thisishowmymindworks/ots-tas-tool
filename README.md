# OTS TAS Tool
An Electron application that enables the creation and running of TASes (tool assisted speedruns) in Out There Somewhere. The application both helps with the installation of the mod required to have OTS run the TAS and acts as a user friendly GUI for creating the TAS itself.
## Prerequisites
For the program to be able to mod OTS you need to download JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler. Download links can be found [here](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases), you should pick the one tagged with "latest release".
## Installing
Simply run the installer executable. The latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/thisishowmymindworks/ots-tas-tool/releases).

For the rest of the setup process either have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/thisishowmymindworks/ots-tas-tool/wiki), or the video guide below (currently slightly outdated).
